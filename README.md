# final_web_sec
This project was created as my final project in my web security class.

The purpose of the project was to display that I could implement some web security features on a web application. I implemented the following features in this project:
* PhpRbac - A php package for role based access control
* Brute force mitigation - The login page only allows for 5 failed logins before the account is locked for a short period.
* SQL injection mitigation - By using PDO with bindParam I am able to mitigate against sql injection

We were given 12 hours to add the above funtionality to a w3c webpage template.
